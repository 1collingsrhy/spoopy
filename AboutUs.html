<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0px;"><u> The Server </u>  </h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">  The server may look like a chair... because that is exactly what he is. Nicknamed the skeleton of uncomfotableness, because he can make people forever uncomfortable in thier computer chair,
  this worker being paid minimum wage will make you feel very awkward when he is taking your order. You might say this is a bad thing but at least he is being real with you unlike most servers. </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0px;"><u> The Restaurant </u>  </h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The resaurant owns most of the set pieces from the Halloween song, Spooky Scary Skeletons. This makes the restaurant look like a graveyard
 so you are fully immersed in the Calcium themed restaurant. The gravestones are a little uncomfortable to sit on but that is because of the Skeleton of Uncomfortableness wishes it to base
